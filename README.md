This repository contains machine readable pinout description files for the
STM32 microcontrollers.

If you want to add a description feel free to submit a pull request.

This repository also contains scripts to compact the pin descriptions and
generate KiCad symbol library.

Suggestions and improvement to the generator scripts are welcome. Consider this
project as "as needed" approach. If you want to see something different or more
in this code you have to implement it yourself. Python is not that hard people!
:P

Look at the description files, the format should be pretty self explanatory.
These are just two tab separated CSV attached behind each other with the '----'
separator between them.
